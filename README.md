# Custom Object Detection with YOLO v8 from Ultralytics

## Overview

Welcome to the Custom Object Detection project utilizing YOLO v8 from Ultralytics. In this project, I've implemented an advanced object detection system, leveraging the power of YOLO v8 for robust and accurate object detection.

## Key Features

- **YOLO v8 Implementation**: Utilized the state-of-the-art YOLO v8 from Ultralytics for robust and accurate object detection.

- **Advanced Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it a powerful choice for applications requiring speed and precision.

- **Efficiency and Speed**: YOLO v8 is designed to be highly efficient, enabling rapid detection of objects in images and videos without compromising accuracy.

## Setting Up the Environment

To replicate and explore this project, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Create Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n ultralytics_yolo python=3.8
    conda activate ultralytics_yolo
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
    pip install ultralytics
    conda install jupyter
    pip install cchardet
    pip install chardet
    pip install label-studio
    ```

    Alternatively, you can clone the Ultralytics GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
    ```
